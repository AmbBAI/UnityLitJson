# TODO:

1. Remove the static writer and just create a new private one each time instead (eliminates need for global lock).
2. Add more error checks for type hinting.
3. Add full XMLDocs to public interfaces.
4. Try to get custom importers/exporters working recursivly.
5. Add xbuild support.
6. README.md needs more information and examples.
7. Fix unit tests that cause mono to crash (something with Enums I think).
